TODO:
* Think about updating store immediately for live sessions?
* Generally examine literal types vs container string lookups
* Give *all* models a type property?
* Should flush update models at the end or stream them in?

Flush Process
1. session flush calls adapter
2. adapter computes dirtiness
  a. field-by-field diffs with store values
  b. potential revision conflicts with latest version in store
