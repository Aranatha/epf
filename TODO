TODO:
* Think about updating store immediately after flush for live sessions?
* Generally examine literal types vs container string lookups
* Give *all* models a type property?
* Think about an ordered model array
* Think about making all model arrays sets
* Make session a subclass of store and add hierarchy

Flush Process
1. session flush calls adapter
2. adapter computes dirtiness
  a. field-by-field diffs with store values
  b. potential revision conflicts with latest version in store
