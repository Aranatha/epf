* Think about updating store immediately after flush for live sessions?
* Generally examine literal types vs container string lookups
* Give *all* models a type property?
* Think about an ordered model array
* Think about making all model arrays sets
* Cleanup old session models (e.g. after merge the promise is replaced)
* Record array manager
* Think through conflicts
