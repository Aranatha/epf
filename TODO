TODO:
* Think about updating store immediately after flush for live sessions?
* Generally examine literal types vs container string lookups
* Think about an ordered model array
* Think about making all model arrays sets
* Cleanup old session models (e.g. after merge the promise is replaced)
* Record array manager
* Think through conflicts
* http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.5/javadoc/org/hibernate/Session.html
* Second level cache mode: http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.5/javadoc/org/hibernate/CacheMode.html
* Flush mode: http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.5/javadoc/org/hibernate/FlushMode.html

* Remove Ember.Deferred from LazyModel and instead simply have a promise property

* Explore Copy on Write (COW) as an optimization

* isNew should not be tied to ID

* setting inverse is broken when set during create

* reuse models during merging if not associated with a session

* type should always be polymorphic base class

* enforce client ids just above the serialization level to simplify checking identity

* merging needs to take into account deletion
